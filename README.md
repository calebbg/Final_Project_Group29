# Group 29 COMP 426 Final Project - Weather API Server

## Summary 

For our project, we used the Open Meteo API to show the weather of a pariticular region, given its Longitude and Latitude.
To begin, go to http://localhost:5500/app/weather
to see the defaulted result of whether or not you need galoshes in New York. 
You can specify the latitude and longitude values as so: http://localhost:5500/app/weather/##/## 
You can also add arguments for the region, city, and the number of days you would like to know about.


COMP426 final project template boilerplate.
All your code and documentation goes here.
Change this text to be a brief description of your final project.
Put the name of your project in the header above.
You will change everything below to be the main technical documentation, as outlined below.

## First steps

Other steps that you will need to take after your team has accepted the assignment:

1. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly. 
2. Edit this README.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to information contained under `/docs/`.
3. Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc.
4. Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository as administrators.
5. Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and user them to manage your project.
7. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this README.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.
9. Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 
10. Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project.

## Team mangement

Plan to meet with your team ASAP.
Talk through identifying roles within your team.
For our project, we created an API which retrieves data from the Open Meteo API to show the weather of a pariticular region on a certain day, given its longitude and latitude. Our goal was to create an application which facilitates the interaction between two APIs, one of our own design which the user interacts with and an existing one which data is retrieved from based on the user's request.


## Team management
This is a collaborative project by calebbg, libinhang, and CodingPineapple22. The roles focused on by each team member are as follows:

Endpoint design, documentation - calebbg\
Front-end design, repository management - libinhang\
Database design, walkthrough presentation - CodingPineapple22\
Planning - All
