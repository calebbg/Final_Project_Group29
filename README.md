# Group 29 COMP 426 Final Project - Weather API Server

## Summary 

For our project, we created an API which retrieves data from the Open Meteo API to show the weather of a pariticular region on a certain day, given its longitude and latitude. Our goal was to create an application which facilitates the interaction between two APIs, one of our own design which the user interacts with and an existing one which data is retrieved from based on the user's request.
