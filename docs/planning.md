## Goals and thought process for project
Before meeting we each took time to consider potential ideas for the project, particularly something that we could execute in the short time frame we had. 
We ended up landing on a plan that would involve building upon the previous assignments throughout the semester, particularly A02 and A04. In doing so, we felt that we
could explore how the major concepts from the course could interact and coalesce into one application. The goal we set out to complete was designing an API which
spoke to a pre-existant API, and the Open Mateo Weather API was a natural fit to this end. Thus we translated the data retrieval functionality from A02 into a combination
of a local function and server endpoints similar to A04 in order to use and present the data in the web browser.

## Meetings and communication
11-28-2022:
- Brainstormed ideas for project, deciding upon the concept described above
- Assigned roles and dividing workload
- Created repository for project and discussed workflow (ensuring we were on the same page in terms of pushing, pulling, merging, etc.)
- Gathered resources for project, such as examples of API documentation

12-05-2022:
- Discussed the functionality that had been implemented and refined aspects of the presentation (notably making instructions clearer within the application)
- Discussed how front-end and database could be implemented, as well as how to handle what we aren't able to finish

Communication between meetings was done through Discussions board in Github (https://github.com/orgs/comp426-2022-fall/teams/group-29/discussions)\
Current and future tasks were managed through a to-do list in Projects (https://github.com/orgs/comp426-2022-fall/projects/12)
